# NoSQL


#### What is it?
NoSQL (aka "not only SQL") is a type of database management system (DBMS) that is designed to handle and store large volumes of unstructured 
and semi-structured data. They are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables (non-tabular). 
NoSQL databases are purpose-built for specific data models and stores data in flexible schemas that scale easily for 
modern applications.

#### SQL VS NoSQL

| SQL                                          | NoSQL                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Relational databases                         | Non-relational databases                                               | 
| Stores Data in tables with rows and columns  | Stores data using various models, eg, documents, key,value, graphs etc.| 
| Uses SQL (Structured Query Language)         | Uses any language                                                      | 
| Vertically scalable (scaling-in)             | Scales horizontally (scaling-out)                                                   | 

SQLand uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data, 
NoSQL databases employ various data models for accessing and managing data, eg, documents, key,value, graphs etc.

#### What language(s) can be used?
Any language!

#### Example NoSQL Schema design


#### NoSQL is scalable. Explain the concept and some benefits of it and any negatives?
They offer benefits such as horizontal scalability, flexible data models, and better performance for certain 
use cases like web applications, big data, real-time analytics, and content management systems.

#### Types of NoSQL Database (as many as you can find?)
Document-oriented (like MongoDB)
Key-value stores (like Redis)
Column-oriented (like Apache Cassandra)
Graph databases (like Neo4j)

#### Case studies
```
1)
MongoDB at eBay: eBay, one of the world's largest online marketplaces, implemented MongoDB to improve its search 
functionality and handle the vast amount of data generated by its users. MongoDB's flexible data model allowed eBay 
to store and retrieve product information more efficiently, resulting in faster search performance and better user 
experience. MongoDB's horizontal scalability also enabled eBay to easily scale its infrastructure to handle peak traffic 
during busy shopping seasons.

2)
Netflix and Cassandra: Netflix, the popular streaming service, relies on Apache Cassandra, a distributed column-oriented 
NoSQL database, to manage its vast catalog of movies and TV shows and deliver personalized recommendations to its users. 
Cassandra's decentralized architecture and linear scalability make it well-suited for handling Netflix's global user 
base and massive data volumes. By leveraging Cassandra, Netflix can ensure high availability and reliability while 
delivering seamless streaming experiences to millions of subscribers worldwide.

# MongoDB
<br>

#### What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database program. It is document-oriented, and it's designed to store 
and manage large volumes of data in a flexible, schema-less manner.
<br>
<br>
#### What are collections in Mongo? 
A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents. Documents within a collection can have different fields. 
A collection is the equivalent of a table in a relational database system. A collection exists within a single 
database.
<br>
<br>
#### What are Documents? 
A document is the basic unit of data storage, comparable to a row in a relational database table. 
However, unlike rows in a relational database, documents in MongoDB are schema-less, meaning each document in a 
collection can have a different structure.
<br>
<br>
#### MongoDB Architecture, how does it work? 

<br>
<br>

#### What are replica sets?
A replica set in MongoDB is a group of mongod processes that maintain the same data set. 
Replica sets provide redundancy and high availability, and are the basis for all production deployments.
<br>
<br>

#### What is sharding?
Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. is a technique used in distributed 
database systems, including MongoDB, to horizontally partition data across multiple servers (shards) to 
distribute workload and accommodate large datasets.
MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.
<br>
<br>

#### Advantages of MongoDB?
- Flexible Schema
- Scalability
- High Performance
- Replication and High Availability
- Rich Query Language
- Document-Oriented Storage: MongoDB stores data in a binary JSON (BSON) format, which closely aligns with the data 
  structures used in modern programming languages. This makes it easier for developers to work with data.
<br>
<br>

#### Disadvantages of MongoDB?
- Memory Consumption
- Complexity of Sharding
- Lack of ACID Transactions
- Learning Curve
